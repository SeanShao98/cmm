(WIP) A structural IO framework of ex-ante cross-market-merger simulation/prediction based on R

## intro

This project is an empirical IO **structural model framework** based in R, focusing on **ex-ante cross-market-merger simulations** to predict anticompetitive effects and bundling incentives.

This project develops a novel and efficient structural estimation model based on `R`, systematically addressing common complex issues in empirical IO, including **complementarity/substitutability**, **network externalities**, and **consumer distribution**. The model leverages vectorized computation to efficiently utilize CPU acceleration, achieving excellent accuracy and convergence speed. The **structural demand estimation model** and the **merger simulation algorithm** represent meaningful contributions.

I have firstly uploaded the meeting slides, which you may find interestingðŸ˜‰. The related working paper will be available on SSRN soon, and all reproducible code will be open-sourced as required by the journal. I will continue to provide updates.

## Update: Jul 24, 2025

Our work is [available at SSRN](https://ssrn.com/abstract=5362691) now!
